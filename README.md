# LT-CRM-GSNI-main

## INTRODUCTION
LT-CRM-GSNI is an algorithm program integrating Laplace transform, characteristic root method, and Gaver-Stehfest numerical inversion（LT-CRM-GSNI）, which is used to solve the coupled pollution model of fracturing flowback fluid in shale gas development between the fracture system and wellbore under elastic outer boundary conditions.

The projection contains 10 files: Figure8.m，Figure9.m，Figure10.m，Figure11.m，Figure12.m，Figure13.m，Figure14.m，Figure15.m，Figure16.m，Figure17.m.

Figure8.m，Figure9.m，Figure10.m，Figure11.m，Figure12.m，Figure13.m，Figure14.m，Figure15.m，Figure16.m，Figure17.m are all command files. Their main purpose is to use the LT-CRM-GSNI algorithm to obtain the chloride concentration in the coupled pollution model of fracturing flowback fluid in shale gas development between the fracture system and wellbore under elastic outer boundary conditions, considering various conditions such as the flowback fluid velocity in the left and right wings of the fracture, the flowback fluid velocity in the wellbore, the flowback fluid velocity at the wellhead, the length of the left and right wings of the fracture, the length of the horizontal well, the height of the vertical wellbore section, and the diffusion coefficient.
